During the later half of high school, a few friends and I were very interested in cryptocurrency.
This was before the [2017-2018 boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_bubble#2017_boom_and_2018_crash), at a time were we mined a little bit and toyed with hardware for fun.

Diving into the [Ethereum ecosystem](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum), I found out about [Ethereum Whisper](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/#whisper), a networking layer that allowed sending messages through the chain. Although I had no idea of blockchain worked, I loved the idea! That's when I started writing some code to recreate it, for fun!

Actually diving in the blockchain intricacies and implications, I soon realized this it's just not appropriate for the use-case (actually, the Ethereum people also understood that, and Whisper doesn't exist anymore ðŸ˜‚).

Doing some more research, I found out about the [Scuttlebut protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Scuttlebutt), which had a similar core idea and a very interesting technology stack!

Considering this, I decided to keep some ideas from both -- targeting an audience that cares about privacy and security before all else -- and continued working on my app. This went on for a few months. This endeavour helped a lot with learning programming, Python and its intricacies, the libraries... but also showing profs and recruiters that I was qualified on this topic. I learned so much about cryptography, Python, how to design an app and think thoroughly of all the edge cases... I'm glad I got to work on that!

In 2020, as part of my Bachelor's Degree, I had the opportunity to work with very different people on the app (a UI/UX designer, a marketing guy, a CS student majoring in network and cybersec, a C dev), which helped quite a lot getting the app off the ground.
We advertised its use among other students, and it actually gained traction for a while, with a peak at around 50 users -- a pretty good impact for such a niche app!

To this day, I continue working on it on-and-off, although there has recently been a lot of architectural changes since first release and it doesn't work out-of-the-box. But hey, I didn't work on this to be a competitor to Whatsapp or the likes: it was first and foremost a fun and exciting journey!

During the later half of high school, a few friends and I were very interested in cryptocurrency.
This was before the [2017-2018 boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_bubble#2017_boom_and_2018_crash), at a time were we mined a little bit and toyed with hardware for fun.

Diving into the [Ethereum ecosystem](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum), I found out about [Ethereum Whisper](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/#whisper), a networking layer of Ethereum that allowed sending messages through the blockchain. My I-don't-have-a-clue-how-this-tech-works self loved the idea! That's when I started writing some code to recreate it, for fun!

Learning about how the blockchain works and its implications, I soon realized that this technology is not appropriate for the use-case (the Ethereum people also understood that, and Whisper doesn't exist anymore).

Doing my research, I also found out about the [Scuttlebut protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Scuttlebutt), which had a similar concept and a very interesting technology stack.

Considering this, I decided to keep some ideas from both -- targeting an audience that cares about privacy and security before all else -- and continued working on my app. This went on for a few years, which actually helped a lot with both learning Python and its intricacies, and showing profs and recruiters that I was qualified with the language. I learned so much about cryptography, Python, but also how to design an app, how to think thoroughly of all the edge cases...

In 2020, as part of my Bachelor's Degree, I got to work on the app with very different people (a UI/UX designer, a marketing guy, a CS student majoring in network and cybersec, a C dev), which helped a lot getting the app off the ground. We advertised its use among students, and it actually gained traction for a while, with a peak at around 50 users, which is very good for such a niche app!

To this day, I continue working on-and-off on the app, although at the moment there has been a lot of architectural changes since version 1, and it doesn't work right now. But hey, I didn't work on this to be a competitor to Whatsapp or the likes ; it was first and foremost a fun and exciting journey!

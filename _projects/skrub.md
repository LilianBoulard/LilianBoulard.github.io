[Skrub](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub) (formerly [dirty_cat](https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat)) is a library for prepping tabular data for machine learning.
It is closely linked to [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), since both libraries share common core contributors (such as [Vincent Maladiere](https://github.com/Vincent-Maladiere), [Guillaume LemaÃ®tre](https://github.com/glemaitre), [Julien Jerphanion](https://github.com/jjerphan), and of course, [GaÃ«l Varoquaux](https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux)).

I started working on the library as soon as I joined Inria, in late 2020, and have been contributing ever since.

At its inception, the library had one objective: encoding non-normalized tabular data. For a congress at [Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay), I created a short video showcasing the use cases and tools provided by the library at the time.

Starting in 2023, we have expended its scope significantly, and I'm happy to have contributed to both the technology behind it and the promotion at multiple conferences and events!

Although it's not my full-time job anymore, I'm still contributing on-and-off to the library, most often giving input on directions and technical decisions.

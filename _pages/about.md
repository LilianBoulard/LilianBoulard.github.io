Hi, I'm Lilian, from France. I graduated with a master's degree from [Université Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay_University) in computer science with a major in data science and machine learning.

Recently, I worked as a machine learning research engineer at [Inria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_for_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Automation) in the [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) then in the [Soda](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) teams, under the supervision of [Gaël Varoquaux](https://gael-varoquaux.info/about.html).

Hi, I'm Lilian, from France. I graduated with a master's degree in computer science with a major in data science and machine learning from [Université Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay_University).

From 2020 to 2023, I worked as a machine learning research engineer at [Inria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_for_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Automation) in the [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) team then in the [Soda](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) team, under the supervision of [Gaël Varoquaux](https://gael-varoquaux.info/about.html).

Early 2024, I started working as a machine learning operations engineer at [Jimini](https://jimini.ai/), a legaltech startup founded by [Stéphane Béreux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanebereux/) and [Raphaël Arroche](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-arroche-a86740a7/). I'm in charge of managing the infrastructure and develop/deploy the models (mostly Large Language Models) and interface these backend services to the front-end.
